Stable tag: trunk


== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to simplify the back-end for non-technical users.  If you are a web developer using WordPress as a CMS for a client, 99% of the time your client will not need to see the Tools or Plugins menus.  Furthermore, they may not use the comments feature at all.  This plugin will let you hide and rearrange back-end features.

Another useful feature is disabling all the default dashboard metaboxes, leaving only the ones added by plugins.

= New Features =
* Clean up editor screen: disable pingback, author, slug, and page attribute metaboxes.
* Hide the WP logo in the top left corner.
* Disable Pages
* Disable Appearance
* Hide the "Quick Edit" link on post & page overview pages.

= Features =
* Relocate "Plugins" and "Settings" links into footer
* Disable Comments
* Disable Tools Menu
* Disable Posts
* Disable Links
* Disable Default Dashboard Widgets
* If front page is set to be a static page, it can be highlighted

Be sure to visit the Settings page to select which features to disable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all the files into your wp-content/plugins directory, be sure to put them into a folder called "wp-simplify"
2. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
3. Configure plugin settings on Settings -> General page
