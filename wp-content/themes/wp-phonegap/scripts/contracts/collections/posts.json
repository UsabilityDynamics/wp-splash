Creating a long list of anthems over his extensive career, the Dutch talent is undeniably one of the most respected names in the music industry today.\r\n\r\nGetting his start at the ripe young age of 16, Ferry sunk his teeth in the record business producing underground hardcore gabber tracks before eventually transitioning to the trance genre. His first single to make it on any chart was \"Don't Be Afraid\" under the alias Moonman - but this was only the beginning for the young talent. Under his solo project of System F, Ferry gave the world a classic in \"Out of the Blue.\" And as Gouryella, a partnership with another trance legend, Tiësto, the two received a gold record for the track, coincidentally called, \"Gouryella.\"\r\n\r\nOver the years, releases like \"Check It Out,\" \"Minack,\" \"Brute,\" \"Punk,\" \"Rock Your Body Rock,\" and \"Feel It\" have cemented Ferry's place among the leaders in electronic music. With his podcast #CorstenCountdown and his imprint Flashover Recordings, Ferry continues to showcase new sounds and artists to the world.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can find Ferry in the studio, still continuing to innovate his sound and inspire new acts even after all these years.

          "post_content":"Producing and remixing extraordinaire, Dyro, has seen his career accelerate at a ridiculous speed. It was only back in 2011 that the then 19 year old decided to start producing, but judging by his success, it's easy to see that his level of talent for exceeds his years. When Dyro put the productions he'd been working on online, one of his own personal heroes Hardwell took notice and played a track of his at Electric Zoo. Subsequently, the track, \"Metaphor,\" was signed to Hardwell's Revealed Recordings.\r\n\r\nKnown for creating massive progressive tracks with electro-tinged drops, Dyro knows exactly how to work that peak-time sound as heard especially in his SiriusXM show Daftastic. Closing out 2013 with mega-hits \"Never Say Goodbye\" and \"Paradise\" with Tiësto, Dyro is marching into 2014 with a new release in \"Black Smoke,\" a slow-burning track with raw, relentless synths.\r\n\r\nArmed with a crate full of energy, get ready to get daftastic as Disco Donnie Presents brings Dyro to a city near you!\r\n\r\n\tDyro in Charlotte, NC on January 31, 2014\r\n\tDyro in Dallas, TX on February 7, 2014\r\n\tDyro in Scottsdale, AZ on March 14, 2014\r\n\tDyro in Houston, TX on March 15, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n[soundcloud url=\"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116443475\" params=\"color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" iframe=\"true\" /]\r\n\r\n[soundcloud url=\"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128648678\" params=\"color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" iframe=\"true\" /]\r\n\r\n[soundcloud url=\"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/95867797\" params=\"color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" iframe=\"true\" /]",

          "post_content":"Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike are at the top of their game right now. Releasing banger after banger, the brothers are undoubtedly one of the hottest names in dance music.\r\n\r\nThough the brothers didn't initially have the same the aspirations about their future career paths, the two first came together in 2003 after Dimitri scored residencies at clubs like Privilege and Space Ibizia. Mike, who had long been MCing hip hop for a while, started flowing on top of Dimitri's sets, just for fun. Party-goers went crazy over the sure-fire formula, but it wasn't until much later that Dimitri and Mike would feel they could commit to music fully as a career. After moving back to Belgium in 2005, the two built their studio and started focusing on producing and the rest, as they say, is history. \r\n\r\nKnown for creating festival style anthems like \"Chattahoochee,\" \"Wakanda,\" and \"Loops &amp; Tings,\" these two are an unstoppable duo. When they aren't packing on the energy in their massive performances around the world, you can catch Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike in the studio or manning their imprint and radio show Smash The House. This February, Disco Donnie Presents is joining the brothers and heading south of the border to \"Smash Mexico.\" Progressive duo Wolfpack will be lending their talents on the cross-country tour as well. \r\n\r\nJoin us on our partnering dates:\r\n\r\nDimitri Vegas and Like Mike in Puebla, Mexico on Wednesday, February 12th\r\nDimitri Vegas and Like Mike in Torreon, Mexico on Thursday, February 13th\r\nDimitri Vegas and Like Mike in Monterrey, Mexico on Friday, February 14th\r\nDimitri Vegas and Like Mike in Mexico City, Mexico on Saturday, February 15th\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/JKv_mdD_Pig",
